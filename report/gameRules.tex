    In every world certain rules apply. This section will explain shortly what rules are important for a basic understanding of the a-ma-zing world of our agents.
    First of all, the intruder must try to get to a target. It is assumed the target's location is known by the intruder, but not by the guards. All agents are aware of their relative position on the map, but they don't know the map itself.
    The goal of the intruder is to visit a target area for 3 seconds or to visits the target area twice with a time difference of at least 3 seconds. The guards win if the intruder is no more than 1.5 meter away and in sight.
	The guards are able to communicate with each other over a so called blackboard. With this they can share coordinates of themselves and of the intruder they spotted. Another way to share knowledge is to work with combined beliefmaps, where all guards place everything they know about the world onto one beliefmap, instead of keeping their knowledge to themselves. If there are multiple intruders, they can make use of their own shared beliefmaps
	Then there are still some small rules such as going through a door gives the agent a time penalty according to how silent he wants to go through, turning too fast makes an agent temporarily blind and walking makes noise according to the speed of the agent. The assumption was made that if the agent hears only one sound, it is his own.
