%Intro to experiments, ideas, reasons
To evaluate our program effectiveness we will conduct a series of experiments to test the different algorithms performance based on their run-time/efficiency and most importantly, how they compare to their counterparts.

%List of experiments
The different aspects of our program we will be testing are:
-Path-finding
-Coverage
-Pursuit
-Avoidance

%Pathfinding experiments
For path-finding we will focus on 2 values, run-time and path length. Obviously
