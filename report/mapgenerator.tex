%Write MapGenerator explanation

The guards and intruders, the so called agent group, also need a world to move in. These worlds consist of a map with walls, doors, windows, targets and everything else that can be found in the world of the agents. It was decided that these worlds could better be generated automatically, to save time. The following sections will explain the algorithms used to generate the maps used in the experiments.
Every algorithm starts by placing the outerwalls; walls that surround the whole world and that do not hold doors nor windows. Next they generate all the other walls and the doors and windows on these walls. These are generated by the specific algorithms. After that, other objects like targets and such are placed on random empty spots on the map.
