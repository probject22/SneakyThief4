%Intro to experiments, ideas, reasons
To evaluate our program's effectiveness a series of experiments are conducted to test the different algorithms performance based on their run-time/efficiency and most importantly, how they compare to their counterparts.

%List of experiments
The different aspects of our program evaluated are, path finding, coverage, pursuit, avoidance and exploration.

%PathFinding experiments
For path-finding the focus is on 2 values, run-time and path length. Obviously the lower either of these values are, the better performance the algorithm has. 

%Coverage 
The most important part of a coverage algorithm is the ratio of covered area compared to the total area of the map. These experiments use StiCo to test the effects of the amount of guards against the map type, map size and map density. 

%Pursuit
The agent's ability to chase/pursue each are tested. The pursuit algorithm being tested be is blocking escape directions(BES) algorithm. It is matched against different avoidance strategies to determine its effectiveness.

%Avoidance
When an intruder sees a guard, it immediately wants to escape capture, this is tested ...
