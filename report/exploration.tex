There is a need for a simple exploration algorithm for the agents; this is because most algorithms work better on an explored maps. (e.g.; the path that A* finds on an explored map is the optimal one, but when the map is not fully explored it is possible that it finds the longest path to the goal.)
For this, we came up with the algorithm that can be seen in listing x

\begin{algorithm}
    \KwData{Current map $M$}
    Select random tile $c$ on $M$\;
    \If{$c$ is not explored}{
        \Return $c$
    }
\end{algorithm}
