%Introduction to A*
			The A* algorithm is a general purpose algorithm that searches a graph and is capable of providing the optimal path from one node to another. A* is a heuristic search and like many heuristic search algorithms its performance depends on the heuristic employed. Although A* always finds the shortest path as long as the heuristic is admissible, i.e. the cost the heuristic estimates always underestimates the actual cost, a better heuristic will shorten the time needed to find this optimal path~\cite{hart1968}. The implemented instance of A* uses Cartesian distance between the current and the goal tile as its heuristic, which is clearly admissible.

%Workings of A*
			A* uses an evaluation function $f(x)$ which depends on the cost function $g(x)$ and the heuristic function $h(x)$.
			\begin{equation}
				\label{eq:astarevaluation}
			 	f(x) = g(x) + h(x)
			\end{equation} 
			At every iteration it will expand the node that has the lowest cost as predicted by the evaluation function (see alg.~\ref{alg:astar}).

			\begin{algorithm}
				\KwData{Starting node $s$; Set of target nodes $T$; evaluation function $f$}
				Mark $s$ as 'open' and calculate $f(s)$\;
				\While{ There are open nodes left }{
    				Select the open node $n$ with the smallest $f$\;
    				\eIf{$n \in T$}{
    					Mark $n$ 'closed' and terminate\;
    				}{
    					Mark $n$ 'closed'\;
    					Let $A$ be the successors of $n$\;
    					\For{$a \in A$}{
    						Calculate $f(a)$\;
    						\If{$a$ is not closed $\vee f(a) < f$ when s was closed}{
    							Mark $a$ as open\;
    						}
    					}
    				}
				}
				\caption{A* algorithm~\protect\cite{hart1968}}
				\label{alg:astar}
			\end{algorithm}

			In the simulations the nodes of the graphs will be simple coordinates, so for the heuristic function the direct distance to the destination coordinate can be taken as the heuristic function.

			A disadvantage of the A* algorithm in path finding is that it will not identify a certain coordinate as unreachable until all possible routes have failed. As this would take too long in most simulations to compute, it is necessary to provide a maximum amount of nodes the algorithm is allowed to explore before it has to give up the search. This, of course, is at the risk of falsely concluding that a certain position is unreachable.

			Another disadvantage of the A* algorithm is that it is necessary to discretise the world in order for the algorithm to run. In real-world applications for robotic systems, most robots will not find themselves in a discrete world. Therefore the A* algorithm will be very unlikely to find the optimal path in continuous world applications. If, however, the discretisation is sufficiently narrow the proposed path will probably be sufficient for most purposes. Unfortunately, narrowing the discretisation inherently leads to the need for more computing power.\cite{ASta2:online, korf1990real}

			\subsubsection{RTA*}
				An adaptation of A* to be more accommodating to real-time applications is Real-Time A* (RTA*). When the computational resources are insufficient to at every step recalculate the entire path from the agent to the goal, this method should be employed. It is very similar to regular A* with the adaptation that an agent is immediately moved to the most promising direction, instead of first calculating the entire path. This way A* loses its optimality, but it will execute a lot faster, which is necessary when computing long paths for many agents~\cite{korf1990real, rtastar, undeger2009real, undeger2010multi, undeger2007single}.
