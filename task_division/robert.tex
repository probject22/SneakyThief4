\subsection{Current Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item~\marginpar{15/05}
	Describe the STICO algorithm in the report
		\subitem May suffer delay due to problems in vision implementation.
		\subitem Delayed to after 22/05
	\item~\marginpar{20/05}
	Implement the interpretation of vision by the agent
		\subitem May suffer delay due to problems in vision implementation
	\item~\marginpar{15/05}
	Implement the STICO algorithm
		\subitem Delayed due to problems in the vision implementation
	\item~\marginpar{15/05}
	Hook up the STICO algorithm to the agent
	\item~\marginpar{16/05}
	Implement map-building into the STACO algorithm
		\subitem May suffer delay due to problems in vision implementation
	\item~\marginpar{15/05}
	[Unexpected] vision did not work properly, so this needs to be solved.
		\subitem Problem was more severe than expected. Postponed to 18/05.
